## Notes

While building this app, I ran into a couple of build errors when first creating the application as well as when adding a dependency to the gradle.build file. I was able to solve these errors by doing a bit of research. The walkthrough video
also took me about 3 trys to get perfect as pop ups from android studio interfered with the recording screen a couple of times. Ultimately, this was a great learning experience as I was able to learn a couple of tricks along the way that I was unaware of.
